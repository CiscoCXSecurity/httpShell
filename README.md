##Description:
This is an obfuscated client/server reverse shell. 

If running as client, this application will act like an HTTP client (web browser),
making HTTP requests to the server. These requests will be encoded using the dictionary
files specified by the user. These requests will contain the results of the bash commands
send in the HTTP responses.

If running as the server, this application will act like an HTTP server, answering HTTP requests
sent by the client or by actual web browsers. The HTTP responses will bash commands encoded
into the dictionary file specified by the user.
