NAME:
		httpShell - obfuscated reverse shell that looks like HTTP 

DESCRIPTION
		This is an obfuscated client/server reverse shell. 

		If running as client, this application will act like an HTTP client (web browser),
		making HTTP requests to the server. These requests will be encoded using the dictionary
		files specified by the user. These requests will contain the results of the bash commands
		send in the HTTP responses.

		If running as the server, this application will act like an HTTP server, answering HTTP requests
		sent by the client or by actual web browsers. The HTTP responses will bash commands encoded
		into the dictionary file specified by the user.

		--port
				Port for the server to listen on, or port for the client to connect on

		--host
				address or domain name of the server (ony used by client)

		--delay
				amount of time to wait between http request (only used by client)

		--password
				data is aes192 encrypted on the wire. this is the shared secret

		--dict
				encoding dictionary file to be used (file with line deliniated words....).
				This will be used for both client and server if the next two aren't specified

		--clientdict
				encoding dictionary file to be used by client(file with line deliniated words....).
				you should probably build a dictionary that looks like something a browser would send

		--serverdict
				encoding dictionary file to be used by server(file with line deliniated words....).
				you should probably build a dictionary that looks like something a web server would send
