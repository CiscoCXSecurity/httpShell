        httpShell - obfuscated reverse shell that looks like HTTP\n\n\

  Description:\n\t\
        This is an obfuscated client/server reverse shell. \n\n\t\

        If running as client, this application will act like an HTTP client (web browser),\n\t\
        making HTTP requests to the server. These requests will be encoded using the dictionary\n\t\
        files specified by the user. These requests will contain the results of the bash commands\n\t\
        send in the HTTP responses.\n\n\t\

        If running as the server, this application will act like an HTTP server, answering HTTP requests\n\t\
        sent by the client or by actual web browsers. The HTTP responses will bash commands encoded\n\t\
        into the dictionary file specified by the user.\n\n\
